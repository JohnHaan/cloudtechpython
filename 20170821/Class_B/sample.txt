Docker strives for profit with new Enterprise Edition

DEE provides a container management platform that unites Windows, Linux, and
Mainframe apps on a single platform on the same cluster.
This puts in competition with container orchestration market leader Kubernetes.
Docker's program provides customizable and flexible access control for Bring Your Own
environments, support for a broad range of applications and infrastructure types,
and new capabilities for creating predefined policies that unify and automate
the software supply chain.
